# Edit this file to change how the setup script sets up the OBC simulator.    #
# You can add comments by typing # before your comment. All commands need to  #
# be on a single line, if you wish to have a command across multiple lines    #
# you need to type \ at the end of the line to also include what is on the    #
# next line.                                                                  #
#                                                                             #
# Configuration options:                                                      #
#  - setaddress <addr>: Sets the address that the OBC simulator will use to   #
#                       communicate with your experiment. The address must be #
#                       an integer value between 0x00 and 0x7F.               #
#  - setmtu <mtu>: Sets the MTU that the OBC will use when communicating with #
#                  your experiment.                                           #
#  - addcommand <name> <opcode>: Adds a custom command with the specified     #
#                                and opcode value. The opcode value must be   #
#                                between 0x50 and 0x7F. Opcodez starting with #
#                                0x5X will be system commands, 0x6X will be   #
#                                requests, and 0x7X will be sends.            #
#  - setdefaultdata <name> <data>: Sets the default data to be sent along     #
#                                  with a send opcode. See available data     #
#                                  types to see how data can be formatted.    #
#  - setprintstyle <name> <style>: Set how received data from requests should #
#                                  be printed. The different styles are:      #
#                                  - none (default for send)                  #
#                                  - bytes (default for request)              #
#                                  - bits                                     #
#                                  - string                                   #
#                                                                             #
# Default already specified commands are ACTIVE, SLEEP, POWER_OFF,            #
# REQ_PAYLOAD, REQ_HK, REQ_PUS, SEND_TIME, SEND_PUS. You can use these in     #
# setdefaultdata, setprintstyle, and invoke.                                  #
#                                                                             #
# After having set up all the commands, you need to specify the sequence in   #
# which your commands will be called from the OBC. This needs to occur after  #
# all configuration options in the file. To start specifying the sequence,    #
# you need to write one of the following:                                     #
#  - sequence init: Runs the below sequence once when starting up.            #
#  - sequence loop: Runs the sequence in an infinite loop.                    #
#                                                                             #
# The sequence can consist of the following actions:                          #
#  - invoke <name> [data]: Starts a transaction with the command associated   #
#                          with the name. If the command is a send, some data #
#                          must be associated with this action or the command #
#                          must have a specified default data. See available  #
#                          data types for how data can be formatted.          #
#  - wait <millis>: Waits the specified number of milliseconds before         #
#                   running the next action.                                  #
#                                                                             #
# Available data types:                                                       #
#  - Array of bytes: Starts with a curly bracket, followed by a comma         #
#                    separated sequence of bytes, and ends with a curly       #
#                    bracket.                                                 #
#                    Ex: {0x11, 0x26, 0xa9}                                   #
#  - Repetition of a byte: Formatted as repeat(value, times), where 'value'   #
#                          is the value to be repeated 'times' times.         #
#                          Ex: repeat(0x33, 976)                              #
#  - String: Starts with a double quotation mark, followed by a sequence of   #
#            characters, and ends with a double quotation mark. Multiple      #
#            strings that follow in a sequence will be concatenated together. #
#            Each string, in a sequence or by itself, must occur on one line  #
#            in its entirety.                                                 #
#            Ex1: "hi, msp"                                                   #
#            Ex2: "just say" "hello" (resulting string: "just sayhello")      #
#            Ex3: "with a " "space" (resulting string: "with a space")        #
