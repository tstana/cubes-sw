 * Defines functions for sending and receiving data over MSP from an OBC
 * perspective. Also defines a link struct for keeping track of the state
 * towards an experiment. The link struct includes variables that keep track of
 * things such as the address of the experiment, previous transactions-ID's,
 * the current transaction-ID, the opcode of the current transaction, etc.
